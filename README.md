# Waves_Lab_Experiment

Waves project carried out in the Hydraulic Engineering Lab at TU Delft.

Aim of the project: observing the differences in energy dissipation for different wave conditions 
and transfer to different frequencies. 
This resulted in the following main research question:
How do properties of a wave field affect its energy distribution when near-shore conditions are encountered?
In order to answer these question, the following subquestions are considered:
1) Is the wave breaking frequency dependent?
2) How does the Iribarren number affect the energy distribution during breaking?
3) What is the effect of (non-)linearity of a wave field on energy dissipation due to bed friction?
4) How do triad-wave interactions affect the energy distribution during shoaling?
